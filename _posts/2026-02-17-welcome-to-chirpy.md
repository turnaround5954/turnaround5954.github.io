Welcome to my new blog, powered by the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme! This is the first post, and I'll use it to show off some of the features you can use in your own posts.

## Markdown Examples

### Headings
Use `#` for headings – up to six levels.

### Lists
- Unordered list item
- Another item
  - Nested item

1. Ordered list item
2. Second item

### Code Blocks
Here's a Python snippet:
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Chirpy!")
```
