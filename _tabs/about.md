## 👋 Hello
![img-description](/assets/img/avatars/usagi.jpg)
I'm an NLP Engineer with a passion for building large-scale multimodal systems that power content understanding and recommendation. Currently at ByteDance (Douyin), I focus on optimizing UGC distribution through cutting-edge embeddings and real-time trend detection. Previously at Baidu, I developed device fingerprinting and user profiling technologies that operated at the scale of hundreds of billions of relationships.
