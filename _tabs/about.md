## 👋 Hello
![img-description](/assets/img/avatars/usagi.jpg)
At ByteDance (Douyin), I am an NLP Engineer specializing in large-scale multimodal systems that drive content understanding and recommendation. I optimize UGC distribution by leveraging state-of-the-art embeddings and real-time trend detection. Previously at Baidu, I built and scaled device fingerprinting and user profiling technologies for billions of users and a graph of hundreds of billions of device relationships.

## 💼 Work Experience

### ByteDance · Shanghai  
**NLP Algorithm Engineer – Douyin Content Technology**  
*2022.07 – Present*

- Designed and implemented multimodal embeddings that enhanced UGC distribution within Douyin's recommendation system, achieving **+0.3% uAUC** and **+0.0038% LT** gains in core recommendation metrics
- Developed real-time recognition pipelines for trending topics and memes, which powered trend-focused features and channels, achieving **+1.38% average active days** per user and **+1.02% topic open rate** among users with over 5 seconds of engagement, along with a **+0.003% lift** in overall long-term conversion (LT).

### Baidu · Beijing  
**Machine Learning Engineer – Security Department**  
*2018.07 – 2022.06*

- Developed device fingerprinting technology using graph-based relationship modeling and machine learning to assign stable unique IDs to devices without user login.
- Introduced unsupervised adversarial training (DANN) to handle feature sparsity, reducing false positive rate **below 0.1%** .
- Built a unified user profiling system with PLE and MIND models, predicting demographic attributes and interest tags at scale.
